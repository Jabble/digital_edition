# Assessing Technology-based Projects for Promotion and/or Tenure in ARL Academic Libraries
Karen G. Lawson and Nancy L. Pelzer

''Little'' is "known" about *how* technology—based **projects** (computer software, articles in electronic journals, Internet-based materials, videotapes and audiotapes) are reviewed for promotion and/or tenure purposes in academic libraries. Reviewers might evaluate projects with traditional criteria or attempt to revise criteria to accommodate computer-related work. To address this issue in more detail, the authors conducted a study to assess how technology-based projects are evaluated in the promotion and/or tenure process for academic librarians in Association of Research Libraries. Survey results show that, while projects, particularly World Wide Web—based materials, are being evaluated in some ARL academic libraries, little has been developed as a core set of measures or assessments for promotion and/or tenure decisions

- Changes in methods of publication and in the nature of research and its resulting prodructs are raising difficult questions in the arena of the scholarly reward system. 

Several years ago, as administrators began to talk positively about technology and its benefits to the University community, efforts such as developing computer programs, writing reviews of software, and publishing in electronic journals were perceived by some in the academic world as coming into their own as legitimate forms of scholarship. By 1997, the winds on campuses appeared to have shifted and the earlier enthusiasm of scholars was being tempered by skeptical departments and committees reviewing candidates for promotion and / or tenure. The Modern Language Association’s Guidelines for Evaluating Computer-related Work in the Modern Languages specifies "recognition of contributions by faculty members" as one of the guidelines for support of computer technology and recommends that "colleges and universities should develop a written policy concerning the evaluation of electronic publications m' the tenure and promotion process so that faculty members can make their decision about appropriate ways to distribute their research.” These guidelines, however, lack suggestions as to how specific kinds of computer-related activity should be evaluated within the traditional categories of professional practice, research, and service or how the traditional categories might best be revised to accommodate work with new technologies.
